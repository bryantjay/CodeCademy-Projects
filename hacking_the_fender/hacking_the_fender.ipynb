Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to The Fender‘s systems, you must update his \"passwords.csv\" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.\n",
